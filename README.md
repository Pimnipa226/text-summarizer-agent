## Inspiration
As university students, we must stay organized to handle schoolwork, extracurriculars, part-time jobs, and other responsibilities. For this, many of us rely on productivity tools like Confluence and Jira from Atlassian. As life gets busy, itâ€™s easy to miss critical tasks, so we wanted to create a tool to solve this issue. We specifically wanted to help teams working on projects together ensure they do not miss important action items as they plan out next steps during team meetings.

## What it does
RovoTasks uses AI to analyze meeting minutes and extract the most important action items for the team. It outputs the list of key tasks to the user via the Rovo Agent in a user-friendly interface.

## How we built it
The Atlassian workshop at DubHacks helped us understand the capabilities and get set up with the Forge platform and Rovo Agent tools. We then completed more tutorials on the Atlassian Developer site to get comfortable with the tools before creating RovoTasks using what we learned.

## Challenges we ran into
Since none of the team members were familiar with the Atlassian developer tools prior to DubHacks, it took us a while to learn them. Other challenges we ran into included getting permission access for these tools and configuring dependencies. Lastly, we learned that using Forge to extend Atlassian productivity apps is not yet available for tools like Loom and Trello, which placed a big limitation on what we could create.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we took on the challenge of trying out new tools despite the steep learning curve. We also worked well as a team to ensure we distributed the tasks effectively based on our interests.

## What we learned
We learned that Atlassian offers many developer tools to extend their productivity apps like Jira and Confluence. It would be interesting to explore new features in more depth after the hackathon.

## What's next for RovoTasks
We are interested in further improving RovoTasks by adding the following features: an extension to Confluence where meeting minutes can be stored initially, and an extension to Jira where the action items can be uploaded as a task list to simplify the user experience.# text-summarizer-agent
